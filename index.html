                Thesis: Elucidating the cell size control mechanism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. 
                Used a data-mining strategy to identify highly expressed genes in Chlamydomonas whose flanking sequences were tested for the ability to drive heterologous nuclear transgene expression.
                Identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting in Chlamydomonas.
                Characterized a sizer protein TNY1, which modulates cell-size homeostasis through cell-cycle-controlled synthesis and dosage-dependent repression of the size activator CDKG1.
                Measured the nuclear:cell volume ratio in wild-type Chlamydomonas and size mutants throughout the multiple fission cell cycle using fluorescence microscopy.
                Established stochastic models for growth and division to elucidate the functions of both commitment and mitotic sizers in the size homeostasis of Chlamydomonas.

                Compared pathogenic interactions between agrobacterium and E.coli on Solanum lycopersicum.
                Improved transgene method on Lemnaceae (increased transgene efficiency from 20% to 80%), based on floral dip method on Arabidopsis thaliana (Cooperated with Dr. Jörg Schwender’s lab at Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY).
