A CV type webpage 

## Notes ##

Project Start: Sometime before February 4, 2022

Version 1:
* Archived N/A date<br>
* Used WordPress.  Client unsatified with layout from Wordpress theme/template.  Requested a specific type of website with left sidebar and layout with date columns.  Decided to code website, not use CMS, and use git to log changes.  unfortunately, did not save WordPress files and database/content were deleted.

Version 2: 
* Archived February 5, 2022<br>
* Tried emulating a template which featured a main hero landing image and hamburger menu.<br>
* Unable to replicate responsiveness and styling.  Decided to code from scratch.
 
Version 3:
* Archived March 1, 2022<br>
* This version was not mobile responsive and client unsatified with formatting.<br>
* Decided to use a CSS framework to ensure mobile responsiveness and for rapid deployment.<br>


Version 4 (current version):
* Initialized March 1, 2022<br>
* Chose Pure CSS and used side bar layout provided<br>
